# Gram Blog Engine

Gram is a personal lightweight blog system. It aims to be the fastest and slickest blog running on Java. It powers [theandrewbailey.com](https://theandrewbailey.com/).

## Features

* [Gram serves RSS feeds.](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) Feeds are served for all articles, articles by category, all comments, and per-article comments. RSS feeds are also used to backup and restore articles and comments.
* Export the entire site as a zip, which can be imported to restore it.
	* Gram also has a static site generator, which exports a zip of the site without comment, search, and administrative functionality. The files inside can be hosted anywhere you'd like.
* [Write blog posts in markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), and preview the page before posting. (A markdown dingus is also available.)
	* The first paragraph and image (if applicable) are pulled into a link and summary shown on the homepage.
	* Preview feature estimates page size, and will show warnings if estimate exceeds limits.
	* [Gram uses commonmark-java (with all first-party modules enabled) for Markdown functionality.](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java)
* Host multiple blogs from one server. Additional blogs must use a unique hostname.
* [Gram uses Postgres' full text search functionality.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html) [The search box features custom spellcheck and autocomplete.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html)
	* On a blog post page, its title is searched (can be overridden), and those results are shown at the end of the article as a 'you might also like' feature. The links are presented similarly to the homepage.
	* Links on the homepage, sidebar, and the 'you might also like' area won't list the same article between them (if you have enough articles).

Gram is optimized for page load speed:

* Internal links are preloaded when they are shown on screen. Clicking those links will swap the page with the preloaded version.
* Up to 100 pages are stored in an internal cache, and are automatically dropped when not requested for a while (must get more than 1 hit per hour to stay).
* Images will lazy load [(via `<img loading="lazy">`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#loading), except for all images of an article on its page, and the first 2 images of the homepage.
	* When left alone, lazy load images will load in, one by one, every 5 seconds or so (based on initial page load time) until all images are fully loaded.
* Responsive images supported. Images must be prepared externally, because Gram will not resize and encode automatically ([see avifify.sh for more](https://gist.github.com/theandrewbailey/4e05e20a229ef2f2c1f9a6d0e326ec2a)).
	* When posting an article with images, image uploads are searched by name, file type (see `site_imagePriority` configuration), and dimensions (named *image*Ã—*n*). All matched images will be placed in [a `<picture>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) with the original.
	* Lowest resolution images are displayed in article summaries. The preload function will replace them with higher resolution images on hover if available.
* Pages and files are compressed with gzip, [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) (via [Brotli4j](https://github.com/hyperxpro/Brotli4j)), and [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) (via [zstd-jni](https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni)).
* [HTTP cache headers are set on every page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching), and are set to 100,000 seconds (a bit more than a day). [HTTP Etag headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) use a SHA-256 hash of the meaningful data served.
	* Images, CSS, and JS have unique URLs based on upload time and are served with Cache-Control: immutable
* [Server-Timing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Server_timing) headers are set on every page with a breakdown of some important performance impacting steps.
* Posts are converted from markdown to HTML when created and updated. The HTML is saved and not re-converted on every request.

Security is important!

* All headers checked by [SecurityHeaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/) are supported, including [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), [feature policy, and permissions policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy).
* [Subresource integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) is used for all CSS and JS files.
* All form fields are obfuscated on a per-visitor/session basis.
* [Gram uses argon2 to hash passwords.](https://github.com/Password4j/password4j)

## Architecture

Gram runs on [Java](https://openjdk.org/), [Payara](https://www.payara.fish/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), and Linux [(Debian)](https://www.debian.org/), and written and built with Netbeans. It should run on other Linux distros and Jakarta EE servers without much difficulty (untested), and other databases with a bit of effort.

Gram is a monolith, built with Jakarta EE Servlets, JSPs, and an EJB. This isn't a car shop: no springs or struts here.

## Setup guide

(Having trouble? Open an issue on this repository.)

1. Download `gram.war` release and [`setupUsTheBlog.sh`](https://github.com/theandrewbailey/gram/blob/master/setupUsTheBlog.sh) from the repository. Run `setupUsTheBlog.sh`.
	1. This script will create will create a directory, `~/gram`, and dump most stuff there. (Feel free to create it yourself and put the war and script there.) Payara will be extracted to `~/payara6`.
	1. This script will setup a Postgres database, download Payara, setup a domain on Payara (and slightly optimize it), and deploy `gram.war`.
	1. The last 7 or so lines are important. Save them somewhere. If you don't, they will be placed in `~/gram/passwords.txt`.
1. Setup Gram.
	1. Go to the Gram homepage. The script will let you know the URL, like https://localhost:22981
		* The HTTPS certificate is self signed. It's OK to ignore that error.
		* You should see a configuration page with lots of text boxes.
	1. If you have a backup, upload it at the bottom of the page at "Have a backup?", and skip the rest of this.
	1. Set passwords for administrative tasks (YOU MUST CHANGE THESE):
		* admin_editPosts
			* Enter this at /adminLogin to add and edit posts, list all articles and comments posted, and delete comments.
		* admin_files
			* Enter this at /adminLogin to list files uploaded to the blog, along with options to upload more or delete. Images, CSS, and JS can live here.
		* admin_health
			* Enter this at /adminLogin to show a health page, displaying some vital stats about the server and site. You can also view errors (as an RSS feed), and reload the site (drop all caches and redirect to homepage).
		* admin_imead
			* Enter this at /adminLogin to show this configuration page.
		* admin_importExport
			* Enter this at /adminLogin to download or upload a site export. This password should be the strongest since it can affect every piece of data and configuration on this site.
	1. Pay attention to other options:
		* page_title
			* This is the site's name and page titles.
		* site_security_baseURL
			* This is the URL where the blog expects to be. There is no room for substitutions or exceptions when it comes to the URL. Accessing the blog by any other URL (even if substituting IPs for domains or changing HTTP to/from HTTPS) will cause problems and is unsupported.
		* site_backup
			* [The site will observe International Backup Awareness Day at 1am local time every day.](https://blog.codinghorror.com/international-backup-awareness-day/) All articles, comments, configurations, and uploaded files will be dumped into this directory, along with timestamped zip of the same that can be uploaded to quickly restore the site (see "Have a backup?" at bottom of the page, and `admin_importExport`). The script will set this as the gram directory it created.
		* site_css, site_javascript
			* These are the CSS and JS files that are put on every page (one file per line). These should match up with an uploaded file (see `admin_files)`. The default style isn't great, but it's on purpose.
		* site_security_* options are mostly regex filters or HTTP headers.
		* page_* options are little bits of visible text scattered around pages. HTML entities will be escaped automatically. You'll probably want to customize a few of these later. Seriously, if you see a piece of text somewhere, you can change it from here. You can make the comment form a complaint form, haha!
		* site_* options are configurations that aren't seen, and aren't escaped.
	1. Gram will call external programs during use:
		* site_healthCommands
			* These programs are called on the health check page (see `admin_health`), with their outputs shown.
	1. Click Save and start blogging!
		* WARNING: sessions expire after 1 hour, and you can't save unpublished blog posts. Instead, write your magnum opus blog post in some other text editor of your choice, then copy+paste the text into Gram.
		* Tip: upload all your images first before publishing your post.
		* While Gram supports multiple locales, there's no support for a single article translated into multiple languages. It was implemented for skinning purposes. [Tip: try using private use extensions.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/locale/extensions.html#private)
			* Access locales by appending the locale to the URL, e.g. https://theandrewbailey.com/x-scrolls/, or look at any page's source for `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="..." href="...">` elements.
1. To start Payara again after a reboot, run `~/payara6/glassfish/bin/asadmin start-domain gramPayara-xxxxx` where `gramPayara-xxxxx` is the Payara username that the script gave you. (You kept that info, right? I told you it's important!)
1. To setup another blog on the same server, an additional database must be created and registered as a JDBC resource (named "java/gram/`domain.name`") in Payara.
	1. Run `setupUsTheBlog.sh -a domain.name`
		* The new blog will be available at `https://domain.name`.
		* Obviously, DNS must be configured correctly for this to work, but this guide will not cover that. I'm tired!
	1. Follow the link that the script gives you, and repeat step 2 for this new blog.

I'm using [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) in front of Payara to handle port conversions, HTTPS, HTTP/3, and another cache layer. However, I've run Payara directly on the internet with nothing between:

* Port numbers can be changed in the admin console. (Configurations > server-config > HTTP Service > HTTP Listeners > http-listener-1, http-listener-2)
* TLS certificates (like from Let's Encrypt) must be added in `~/payara6/glassfish/domains/gramPayara-xxxxx/config/keystore.p12` which uses the Payara master password (if using the script, it's the same as admin console login). You can setup a HTTPS-only redirect in Configurations > server-config > Network Config > Network Listeners > http-listener-1 > HTTP tab > Redirect Port.

## Notes

The default setup assumes you're running Linux on x86-64 CPUs. If you're not, download the relevant JARs for [Brotli4j](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/aayushatharva/brotli4j/) and [zstd-jni](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/luben/zstd-jni/).

Gram Blog Engine was formerly known as the Toilet Blog Engine. [I changed it because this code's purpose isn't to serve files, but web pages.](https://wiki.loadingreadyrun.com/index.php/Installation_Anxiety)
